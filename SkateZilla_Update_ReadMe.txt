F-16 High Fidelity Flight Dynamics and Tech/Academic Initial Demonstration
Build 03-19-2014-0
(Fixed Texture Loading)

Update to: Cpt.Smileys v.3 Build

Important Notes:
This is a High Fidelity Flight Dynamics and Tech/Academic Initial Demonstration,
and it NOT a Combat Ready or Systems Ready Module.
There Are No Functioning Cockpit Systems.

Do NOT Use the External 3D model or Cockpit Model EDMs outside of this Module.
Anyone Caught Moving the 3D External/Cockpit EDMs to Private/Hacked/Jury Rigged Mods, 
Even for Personal Use will be dealt with harsely as it violates the license Agreements for the 3D Assets.
So Once Again, Do NOT use the 3D Model EDMs with any private Mods.
